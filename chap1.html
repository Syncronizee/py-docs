            <h1>A Brief Introduction To Python</h1>
            <p>Python itself is a very powerful programming language, very easy to read and also used for many purposes. People use Python for web apps, data analyzation, and a lot more. Check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp">this article (credits to W3Schools)</a> for more information.</p>

            <h1>Setting Up Your Work Environment</h1>
            <p>To set up your work environment, you will need a good and reliable IDE (integrated development environment). For this, I recommend using <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/'>Visual Studio Code</a> (commonly abbreviated as VS Code) or <a href='https://atom.io/'>Atom</a>.</p>
            <p>Also you will need to set up the Command Line (Terminal for MacOS and Command Prompt for Windows). This is very important for important stuff like installing packages or pushing files to GitHub.</p>
